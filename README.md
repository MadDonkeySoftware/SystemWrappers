# SystemWrappers

This project was built in order to help aid in unit testing calls against objects that are not testable in .Net currently. This project code has been carried around a few different projects from version older than .Net 4.5 so when applicable it may be better to use the built in interfaces. This project's second goal is to support wrappers for system calls of mono to facilitate applications being built on the windows stack compiling and running on the linux stack as well. As always, please feel free to create any Pull Requests to add in additional wrapper methods you may need.
